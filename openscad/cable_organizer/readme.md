# Customizable Cable Winder

This is cable organizer that I have created to get my micro usb cables get better organized. Thing is developed with OpenSCAD and you can customize is to your needs. Sources are included - enjoy!

This thing is inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:570074 but I wanted spool that has smoother angles so it would not bend cable too much and made some holes so cable has more space inside and easier to access.

To make thing more durable use PETG plastic, but PLA will work as well. 

Hint 1. Pins are very fragile in order not to break them during assembly bend the body a little it will prevent pins to be broken.

Hint 2. After assembly even if some pins are broken you can melt plastic with soldering tool to make the whole thing stronger.
